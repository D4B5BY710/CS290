  <h1>CS 290 - Code Blog 4 - November 18, 2019</h1>

  <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

  <p>The most challenging portion of this assignment was understanding node and how it can be utilized. Based on our assingment and our
     utilization of node we barely scratched the surface of its capabilities. One issue I encountered was when I was trying to open the
     the index.html page, none of the css and javascript would be applied to the page, in which I was able to solve by applying the correct content
     types to the following. Another issue I had was trying to have the server listen on the port specified by the environment variable,
     in which I was able to get this figured out by looking up some things on stack overflow.</p>

  <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

  <p>One of the things I learned in this assignment was creating a server as well as learning about the functionality and purpose of a server.
     Along with learning about a server I also became acquainted with ports and from that I was introduced to environment variables and ports.
     Another thing I learned within this assignment was about the parts and pieces that make up http, in which there are compenents to each link,
     and how those things can be requested and be responeded too.</p>

  <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures?
      The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

  <p>The resources that I found to be the most helpful for completing this assignment was the provided example code, I felt like this resource
     made the assignment very straight forward and somewhat simple in terms of complexity. Another than that I used basic CS websites to answer any
     questions I ran across and my answers rather quickly. Other than those, I did not use any other resources to complete this assignment.</p>

  <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

  <p>One thing that I had to google for this assignment was gaining a better understanding on what an environment varieble was and more specifically,
     having a server listen on the port specified by the environment variable. Another thing that I had to google was what other content types were,
     based on what type of file was being requested. From this I needed to know how to respond with the correct content types.</p>
