  <h1>CS 290 - Code Blog 5 - December 6, 2019</h1>

  <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

  <p>The most chellenging portion of this assignment was dealing with the handlebars, in which it became most difficult to understand
     when trying to sort what needed to be included in each of them. One issue in particular that I was experiencing was I not paying close attention
     to what I had include in my handlebar files and my sell something button and modal stoped working. This was solved by paying closer attention to
     what was included in each of the handle bar files, in which I accendentally included the modal and button in my main and photoCard handlebar
     files, where it only needs to live in the photoCard file.</p>

  <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

  <p>I leaned a lot about handlebars and how they are utilized, with this being said I learned about what goes into dynamically generating
     a page. I found this entire assignment to be completely new and deffiniatly the most difficult from the standpoint of neededing everything
     to perfect. This assignment requires multiple elements to be very specific, in which I found certain parts to be very tedious, but in the
     end I learned a ton from this assignment.</p>

  <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs?
      How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

  <p>The resources that I found to be the most helpful for completing this assignment was the provided example code I also found the provided
     lecture notes to be extremely helpful for this assignment, in which I found some portions of the of the notes to be step by step. Another
     than that I used basic CS websites to answer any questions I ran across and my answers rather quickly. Other than those, I did not use any
     other resources to complete this assignment.</p>

  <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

  <p>One thing that I had to google had to with handlebars, I had to google this in order to gain a better understanding of what they were and how
     they can be utilized to dynamically generate a webpage. Another thing that I had to google for this assignment was understand the "#each"
     keyword and how is loops through an array, this gave me trouble because this was not something I had dealt with before and was not something
     that I was familiar with, when compared to the standard loops I have used in C and C++.</p>
