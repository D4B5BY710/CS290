  <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

  <p>The most challenging portion of this assignment was getting comfortable with Java Script, although I will say that having experience
     with C and C++ helped with getting familiared with the syntax. Other problems I encountered was trying to get the filters to work, as
     specified in the assignment. More specifically I had issues with figuring out how to approach the condition filter. In the end I was able
     to figure it out by having an array store the condition values and compare that to the selected value. Once this was done I would delete
     the posts that were not selected.</p>

  <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

  <p>Throughout the assignment I found myself moments where my past knowledge would kick in and start to develop a flow throughout the assignment,
     however some of the things I learned were how intuitive Java Script is compared to other languages I have learned. I also learned about
     some of the underlying logic that a website is built upon.</p>

  <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures?
      The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

  <p>The resources that I found to be the most helpful were online tutorials that were based around concepts and logic, as well as the
     basics behind the language Java Script. I would also have some general questions and find that some people had some related issues on Stack
     Overflow, which I found to be helpful as well. Another resource that I would refer to was some of the example code, in which I would test some
     ideas that I had and try to employ those ideas in my code.</p>

  <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

  <p>One thing I had to google was how filter based of the text input, the reason that this was tricky was because it may not be an exact match,
     so I tried to find some built in functions that would parse through the text for me. Other things I had to google were mostly syntax related,
     as well as why some errors would pop up when using the console to find issues.</p>
