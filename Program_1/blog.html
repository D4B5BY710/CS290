  <h1>CS 290 - Code Blog 1</h1>

  <h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h2>

  <p>Overall this assignment was pretty straight forward, but if I did end up having some questions I would refer to
     the provided lecture notes and if that was not enought I would use some internet sources.</p>

  <h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>

  <p>Going into this class I did not have much knowledge of Web Dev, but I have taken other CS classes so the basic
     fundementals of this assignment were not foreign to me. In this assignment I learned how to organize a web page
     by strictly using HTML. I also learned more about the syntax that follows along with learing HTML and where it is
     best to use headings, paragraghs, titles ect. From this I found out that h2 is a smaller sized text then that of h1,
     in which there are levels to the text.</p>

  <h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>

  <p>The resources that I found to be the most helpful for this assignment were the posted lecture noted as well as some
     of the websites that were referenced throughout the CS290 course page. I have not yet found used Piazza for my own
     benefit but I will check on some posts to see how others may of went about solving there own issues, order to gain
     a new perspective.</p>
