# CS 290 Web Development

This repository is an archive of all the programming assignments for CS 290 at Oregon State University taken fall quarter 2019, taught by Rob Hess.

## Course Description

In this course we learned about designing and implementing static web pages using HTML and CSS. We built client-side scripts and dynamic web pages, as well as served static content using a custom Node.js-based server. We also served dynamically generated content using server-side routing and templating and stored site data in a back end data store and accessed it from the client via an API. By the end of the course, we are able to:

- Design and create a moderately complex static web site that conforms to current standards.
- Implement a custom user interface behavior using client-side scripting.
- Implement asynchronous calls for sending data between the client and server.
- Implement dynamically-generated websites using server-side scripting.
- Use basic database commands to create, store and retrieve data in conjunction with a dynamic website.
