  <h1>CS 290 - Code Blog 2</h1>

  <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

  <p>The most challenging part of the assignment for me was trying to use the correct selectors. When trying to find the selector I needed
     I would run into the issue where I would not see the chenges I wanted. In order to solve this problem, it pretty much came down to trial and
     error, as well as looking at the notes that are given out in the course website.</p>

  <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

  <p>The entire assignment was a learning experience for me, due to not having any prior experience in this course. As for myself there
     were no special insights and I did not know any of the material before completing this assignment.</p>

  <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures?
      The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

  <p>I found multiple tutorial videos online to be helpful but no website in particular that I found to be extremely useful, just bits and
     pieces from multiple sources. I also used the example code that was given, which I found to be very helpful when playing around with
     some concepts and ideas that I had. Other then that I did not use any other resources.</p>

  <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

  <p>One thing that I looked up on google was positioning, as well as how to buld a header, in which while I was learning how to build the
     header for the webside I found that I needed to use the key word float, in order to get the look I wanted.</p>
